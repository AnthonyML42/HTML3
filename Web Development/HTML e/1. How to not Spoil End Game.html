<body> <b> Here you can learn how to not be a loud mouth incel and let other people enjoy 'End Game' </b> </body>

<p>
<body> Step 1: Don't spoil it :). Just don't... It's not that hard to not mention it in a group of people or to not shout at the top of you lungs, it's not funny, it's not clever. Literally a gold fish could be more creative than that and it's just irritating and pointless, people who have seen it aren't impressed and people who haven't will just hate you.  </body>
<p>
<body> Step 2: Ask. Ask if they want it spoiled before you go ahead and spoil the entire movie for them. And even if they did annoy you last Saturday when you wanted help to get together with Jeremy and she spat in your face and went home, don't spoil it. </body>
